# What-the-data-says-about-Covid-19
A deep dive into Covid figures from around the world.

## Summary
In this project, I deep-dived into COVID-19 data for the period between January 2020 and April 2022. The data was cleaned and transformed using SQL. Subsequent data visualization was done using Tableau. 

On the first page of my tableau dashboard, my focus was mainly on infection and death rates across the world. I was able to ascertain the number of cases by country and region, the rate of infection (ratio of number of cases to population), as well as track the progression in the number of cases world-wide. There were various surges in the number of new cases, however the largest surge occurred in January of 2022. There did not appear to be any major correlation between infection rate and the population density.

The second page focused on vaccination rates. Within this time period, 57% of the world population was vaccinated with at least one dose. China led the roll-out, and proved very efficient in its distribution, vaccinating about 89% of its population by April 2022. This was a major feat seeing as the country has the largest population. 

## Dataset
